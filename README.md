# Real-time-oversteering-detection-ADAS
This project talks about real time oversteering detection of vehicle using Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense and ESP 32 with MPU 6050
## Introduction
Oversteering is when a vehicle **turns more than the driver intends**, often due to the rear wheels turning faster than the front wheels. This can cause the vehicle to lose control and spin out.
